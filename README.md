# unfaithful

heyyyyyyyy, i don't wanna see you un faith ful

rewrite of asie's old [FaithlessMC](https://github.com/asiekierka/FaithlessMC) for fabric 1.16.5.

Automatically upscales every texture in the game using ~~scale2x~~ 2xbr

Not done yet!

## license

lgpl 3. (FaithlessMC is also lgpl; i didn't look at its source code though, i just happen to also like LGPL for mc mods.)

## issues

* overall issues with "things scale up weirdly"
	* entity models sometimes look weird
	* blocks with detailed models might get messed up
	* animated textures don't upscale each piece individually (there's code for this but it's a bit broke, and disabled rn)
	* Beds look weird
* Cobblestone, in particular, looks like crap for some reason under 2xbr? (i think: just unlucky)
* config file situation isn't great
